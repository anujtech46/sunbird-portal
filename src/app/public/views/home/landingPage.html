                            <p>My GSoC 2017 project was to implement a package for Julia to solve Ordinary Differential Equations
                                using Neural Networks. The purpose of the project was to provide an additional DE solver
                                using Neural Networks which has parallelism in time as the key advantage over other solvers
                                which are iterative in nature.</p>
