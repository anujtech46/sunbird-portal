            <p>In 2000, ten years later, the international community met again at the World Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal,
                an event which drew 1100 participants.</p>
            <p>The forum took stock of the fact that many countries were far from having reached the goals established at the
                World Conference on Education for All in 1990.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The participants agreed on the Dakar Framework for Action which re-affirmed their commitment to achieving Education
                for All by the year 2015, and identified six key measurable education goals which aim to meet the learning
                needs of all children, youth and adults by 2015.</p>

                            <p>My GSoC 2017 project was to implement a package for Julia to solve Ordinary Differential Equations
                                using Neural Networks. The purpose of the project was to provide an additional DE solver
                                using Neural Networks which has parallelism in time as the key advantage over other solvers
                                which are iterative in nature.</p>
