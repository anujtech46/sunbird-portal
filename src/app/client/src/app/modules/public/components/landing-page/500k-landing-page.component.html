            <h5>Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (AIML) fields are all-pervasive in today's world. The technologies,
                tools, etc are rapidly evolving and it is important to keep pace with these to be part of this revolution.
            <br>
                This platform offers some exciting courses around AIML which are best in class, developed by researchers and professionals
                that are pioneers in this domain.
                We hope that this platform will provide an excellent learning experience and makes complex concepts simple to understand
                with an emphasis on hands-on learning.

                            <p>My GSoC 2017 project was to implement a package for Julia to solve Ordinary Differential Equations
                                using Neural Networks. The purpose of the project was to provide an additional DE solver
                                using Neural Networks which has parallelism in time as the key advantage over other solvers
                                which are iterative in nature.</p>

                                The real challenge that needs addressing is the acute shortage of both skills and data.</p>
